Create an AI Podcast

[Documentation](https://docs.play.ai/documentation/get-started/overview) [API Reference](https://docs.play.ai/api-reference/text-to-speech/introduction)

[Documentation](https://docs.play.ai/documentation/get-started/overview) [API Reference](https://docs.play.ai/api-reference/text-to-speech/introduction)

This guide provides a step-by-step approach to using the PlayAI’s Dialog 1.0 model to create a multi-turn scripted conversation between two distinct speakers.

## [​](https://docs.play.ai/documentation/tutorials/tts/dialogs/create-ai-podcast\#overview)  Overview

- This is an async API endpoint.

- You will make a request to trigger podcast generation.

- You will then request another endpoint to see if the podcast is ready.


## [​](https://docs.play.ai/documentation/tutorials/tts/dialogs/create-ai-podcast\#prerequisites)  Prerequisites

- Access your [credentials](https://play.ai/api/keys) (secret key and user ID).
- Development environment for your chosen programming language.

## [​](https://docs.play.ai/documentation/tutorials/tts/dialogs/create-ai-podcast\#steps)  Steps

1

Set up environment variables

Choose your operating system and set up the environment variables:

macOS (zsh)

bash

Windows

Copy

Ask AI

```
echo 'export PLAYAI_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"' >> ~/.zshrc
echo 'export PLAYAI_USER_ID="your_user_id_here"' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc

```

2

Create a new script

Create a new file and add the following code:

Python

JavaScript

Go

Dart

Swift

Rust

Copy

Ask AI

```
import requests
import os
import time

# Set up headers with your API secrety key and user ID
user_id = os.getenv("PLAYAI_USER_ID")
secret_key = os.getenv("PLAYAI_API_KEY")

headers = {
    'X-USER-ID': user_id,
    'Authorization': secret_key,
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
}

```

3

Configure the model and voices

Define the model and select voices for your hosts:

Python

JavaScript

Go

Dart

Swift

Rust

Copy

Ask AI

```
# define the model
model = 'PlayDialog'

# define voices for the 2 hosts
# find all voices here https://docs.play.ai/tts-api-reference/voices
voice_1 = 's3://voice-cloning-zero-shot/baf1ef41-36b6-428c-9bdf-50ba54682bd8/original/manifest.json'
voice_2 = 's3://voice-cloning-zero-shot/e040bd1b-f190-4bdb-83f0-75ef85b18f84/original/manifest.json'

```

4

Add your podcast transcript

Add your scripted conversation in the correct format:

Python

JavaScript

Go

Dart

Swift

Rust

Copy

Ask AI

```
# podcast transcript should be in the format of Host 1: ... Host 2:
transcript = """
Host 1: Welcome to The Tech Tomorrow Podcast! Today we're diving into the fascinating world of voice AI and what the future holds.
Host 2: And what a topic this is. The technology has come so far from those early days of basic voice commands.
Host 1: Remember when we thought it was revolutionary just to ask our phones to set a timer?
Host 2: Now we're having full conversations with AI that can understand context, emotion, and even cultural nuances. It's incredible.
Host 1: Though it does raise some interesting questions about privacy and ethics. Where do we draw the line?
Host 2: Exactly. The potential benefits for accessibility and education are huge, but we need to be thoughtful about implementation.
Host 1: Well, we'll be exploring all of these aspects today. Stay with us as we break down the future of voice AI.
"""

```

5

Configure the API payload

Set up the payload with your configuration:

Python

JavaScript

Go

Dart

Swift

Rust

Copy

Ask AI

```
payload = {
    'model': model,
    'text': transcript,
    'voice': voice_1,
    'voice2': voice_2,
    'turnPrefix': 'Host 1:',
    'turnPrefix2': 'Host 2:',
    'outputFormat': 'mp3',
}

```

6

Send the request and monitor progress

Add the code to send the request and check the status:

Python

JavaScript

Go

Dart

Swift

Rust

Copy

Ask AI

```
# Send the POST request to trigger podcast generation
response = requests.post('https://api.play.ai/api/v1/tts/', headers=headers, json=payload)

# get the job id to check the status
job_id = response.json().get('id')

# use the job id to check completion status
url = f'https://api.play.ai/api/v1/tts/{job_id}'
delay_seconds = 2

# keep checking until status is COMPLETED.
# longer transcripts take more time to complete.
while True:
    response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)

    if response.ok:
        status = response.json().get('output', {}).get('status')
        print(status)
        if status == 'COMPLETED':
            # once completed audio url will be avaialable
            podcast_audio = response.json().get('output', {}).get('url')
            break

    time.sleep(delay_seconds)

print(podcast_audio)

```

## [​](https://docs.play.ai/documentation/tutorials/tts/dialogs/create-ai-podcast\#key-api-parameters)  Key API Parameters

The following API payload define the conversation, speaker details, and audio generation options:

- **`model`**: Specifies the PlayAI’s Dialog 1.0 model to be used. Here, `PlayDialog` supports multi-turn conversation generation.

- **`text`**: Contains the scripted conversation, with each turn prefixed by the speaker’s name (e.g., `"Country Mouse"` & `"Town Mouse"`).

- **`voice`**: URL path to the voice manifest for the first speaker.

- **`voice_2`**: URL path to the voice manifest for the second speaker.

- **`turn_prefix` / `turn_prefix_2`**: Used to specify each speaker’s dialogue turns within the `text` field. For example: `turn_prefix` says `Country Mouse` to indicate the position where Speaker 1’s dialogue and `turn_prefix_2` says `Town Mouse` that indicates the position where Speaker 2’s dialogue parts are.

- **`output_format`**: Format for the generated audio file, typically `wav` or `mp3`.


If you happen to save the code as `country_mouse.py` then Run the code using `python3 country_mouse.py` pointing your terminal to the directory where the `country_mouse.py` file is stored. This will save the `dialogue.wav` in the same working directory.

# [​](https://docs.play.ai/documentation/tutorials/tts/dialogs/create-ai-podcast\#code-explanation)  Code Explanation

This script uses the Dialog 1.0 model to generate a multi-turn conversation between two characters. The `AUTHORIZATION token` and `X-USER-ID` are required for authentication, which you’ll need to replace with your own credentials.

Each line of dialogue is labeled by character name (e.g., “ `Country Mouse`” or “ `Town Mouse`”) to simulate a natural conversation. The script assigns a unique voice to each character using `voice` and `voice2`. On a successful API call, the generated audio is saved as `dialogue.wav`. Any errors are reported with status details.

**To run the script:**

- Replace placeholders in the headers with your API key and user ID.

- Update the `text` with your scripted conversation

- Update the Speaker Details and their respective voices

- Run the script. If successful, an audio file, `dialogue.wav`, will be saved in the current directory, capturing the dialogue as configured.

- This setup can easily adapt to more complex dialogues or different speakers.


# [​](https://docs.play.ai/documentation/tutorials/tts/dialogs/create-ai-podcast\#troubleshooting)  Troubleshooting

- Authentication Issues: Verify your `API key` and `user ID`. Ensure the `AUTHORIZATION` header includes “Bearer ” followed by your token.

- API Endpoint Errors: Confirm you’re using the correct PlayAI’s Dialog 1.0 API endpoint URL and the `model` name is `PlayDialog`
